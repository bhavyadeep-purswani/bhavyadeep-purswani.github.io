With this in mind, we set out to build a platform that went beyond being just a marketplace â€“ a space designed to encourage meaningful connections and experiences. <br /><br />Leading the technical direction of ByChoice, I was able to channel my passion for innovation, creating solutions that bridged the gap between technology and human connection.`,
